# Nodejs-Api

This is a Console Node.js app that takes input from the user and uses Spotify, Twitter, and OMDB's to return tweets, movies, or song results to the user.
Additionally commands can be inserted into the text file 'random.txt' in the form: tweet#<username>, movie#<moviename>, and spotify#<song>name.
Api keys need to be inserted into the key fields in each script where required.
